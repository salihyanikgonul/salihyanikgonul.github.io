			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2014. I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering with Nanyang Technological University and Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR, Singapore. My research interests include the engineering of single-photon avalanche detectors, optical spectroscopy of diamond color centers, and quantum optics with metamaterials. I have been awarded with the Institute of Physics Singapore Outstanding Poster Award in 2019, the Singapore International Graduate Award, and Republic of Turkey Prime Ministry Outstanding Achievement Scholarship.</p>
